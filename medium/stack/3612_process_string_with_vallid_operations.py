"""
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and the special characters: *, #, and %.

Build a new string result by processing s according to the following rules from left to right:

If the letter is a lowercase English letter append it to result.
A '*' removes the last character from result, if it exists.
A '#' duplicates the current result and appends it to itself.
A '%' reverses the current result.
Return the final string result after processing all characters in s.
